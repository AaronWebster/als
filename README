Availability
------------

The latest released version of ALS is always available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.octave.org in the directory /pub/als.

Installation
------------

To compile ALS, you will need a recent version of GNU Octave. 
You will also need the Sundials toolbox (version 2.4) to compile the 
linear time-varying ALS (LTV-ALS) module. The linear ALS module is 
also compatible with recent versions of Matlab (tested under version 
7.6, R2008a). 

Bugs
----

Questions, comments, bug reports, and contributions should be sent to
the bug-als@bevo.che.wisc.edu mailing list.

Documentation
-------------

The linear ALS technique is implemented using the
"als_sdp_mrQ.m" function. Files "simulate_data8.m" and "motivating
example.m" are examples of ALS implementation for simple
systems. Specifically, please see the last few lines of
"simulate_data8.m" for a sample implementation of the ALS method. The
diagonal ALS technique, to estimate only the diagonal elements of the
covariance matrices, is implemented using "als_diag.m", and
"simulate_data8_diag.m" is an example of its implementation. 
The linear time-varying ALS technique for nonlinear and time-varying 
models is implemented using the "ltv_als.m" function and file "case1_als.m" 
provides an example of its implementation. The rest of the functions 
are supporting functions that are not directly called. Documentation 
for each function is also available by typing "help function_name" 
in the octave command window.
